- Launch descriptions are made of up of an ordered list of actions and groups of actions. 
- Actions represent an intention to do something, but a launch description is parsed first, then actions are taken in order of definition later.
    - This allows actions to be interpreted and then statically introspected without actually executing any of them unless desired.
